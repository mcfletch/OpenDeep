        Initialize a basic layer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : List of [tuple(shape, `Theano.TensorType`)]
            The dimensionality of the inputs for this model, and the routing information for the model
            to accept inputs from elsewhere. `shape` will be a monad tuple representing known
            sizes for each dimension in the `Theano.TensorType`. The length of `shape` should be equal to number of
            dimensions in `Theano.TensorType`, where the shape element is an integer representing the size for its
            dimension, or None if the shape isn't known. For example, if you have a matrix with unknown batch size
            but fixed feature size of 784, `shape` would be: (None, 784). The full form of `inputs` would be:
            [((None, 784), <TensorType(float32, matrix)>)].
        outputs : int
            The dimensionality of the output for this model.
        params : Dict(string_name: theano SharedVariable), optional
            A dictionary of model parameters (shared theano variables) that you should use when constructing
            this model (instead of initializing your own shared variables). This parameter is useful when you want to
            have two versions of the model that use the same parameters - such as siamese networks or pretraining some
            weights.
        outdir : str
            The directory you want outputs (parameters, images, etc.) to save to. If None, nothing will
            be saved.
        activation : str or callable
            The activation function to use after the dot product going from input -> output. This can be a string
            representing an option from opendeep.utils.activation, or your own function as long as it is callable.
        weights_init : str
            Determines the method for initializing input -> output weights. See opendeep.utils.nnet for options.
        weights_interval : str or float
            If Uniform `weights_init`, the +- interval to use. See opendeep.utils.nnet for options.
        weights_mean : float
            If Gaussian `weights_init`, the mean value to use.
        weights_std : float
            If Gaussian `weights_init`, the standard deviation to use.
        bias_init : float
            The initial value to use for the bias parameter. Most often, the default of 0.0 is preferred.
        noise : str, optional
            What type of noise to use for corrupting the output (if not None). See opendeep.utils.noise
            for options. This should be appropriate for the output activation, i.e. Gaussian for tanh or other
            real-valued activations, etc. Often, you will use 'dropout' here as a regularization in BasicLayers.
        noise_level : float, optional
            The amount of noise to use for the noise function specified by `noise`. This could be the
            standard deviation for gaussian noise, the interval for uniform noise, the dropout amount, etc.
        mrg : random
            A random number generator that is used when adding noise.
            I recommend using Theano's sandbox.rng_mrg.MRG_RandomStreams.
