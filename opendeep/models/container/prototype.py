    The :class:`Prototype` lets you add :class:`Model`s in sequence, where the first model takes your input

    The :class:`Prototype` is an iterable class, so you can index specific models inside or iterate over them
    with a for loop.

    You can use an :class:`Optimizer` with the container as you would a :class:`Model` - makes training easy :)

        --------
        Here is the sequential creation of an MLP (no `inputs_hook` have to be defined, `add()` takes care
